/**
 * Sway control source for the XR control bus.
 *
 * Publishes the Audima Sway's six expressive dimensions as named manifest entries
 * (`sway.strike` ... `sway.sculpt`, each 0..1) so they are first-class routable
 * signals on the same bus DJ uses, and mirrors their live values out to XR so a
 * headset sees the motion. Unlike djControlSource, Sway is an INPUT: values flow
 * outward to bound targets, so an inbound control-set has nothing to set here.
 *
 * The six dims are target-agnostic. The fan-out to concrete targets (VFX, the
 * Spatializer, MAKE / Magenta generation, the vocal / SoulX path) is the binding
 * layer's job; today a Sway can already drive DJ controls through the existing DJ
 * MIDI-learn, and this source makes the named dims available to everything else.
