"""FastAPI router for the AKVJ module — a Unity-desktop / native-Kinect -> VJ bridge.

Two senders feed the same relay, and the relay forwards their binary messages
verbatim, so it never has to understand the payload:

1. The legacy MJPEG path (Unity Akvj, the maximal-look techie hatch): a Unity
   desktop app JPEG-encodes its rendered view each frame and pushes the frames to
   ``/ws/source``. The VJ ``useAkvj`` hook decodes them as a flat video.

2. The native ``akvj3d`` path (the idiotproof default): a headless Python sidecar
   (pyk4a) opens the Azure Kinect directly and streams a one-time XY unprojection
   table plus per-frame depth16 + depth-aligned color, framed with a small ``AKV1``
   header. The VJ ``useAkvj3d`` hook unprojects that into a live three.js point
   cloud, so the VJ deck owns the look (re-light, point size, noise displacement,
   audio reactivity) instead of receiving pre-rendered pixels.

The relay only peeks at the 5-byte ``AKV1`` header to tell the two table-chunk
messages (which a late-joining viewer must be primed with) apart from frames. A
plain JPEG frame has no ``AKV1`` magic, so the MJPEG path is unaffected.

Delivery is drop-to-latest per viewer: table chunks queue losslessly and in
order, while a newer frame overwrites an unsent one, so one slow viewer can
never stall the source receive loop or the other viewers.

Endpoints (prefix /api/akvj):
    GET  /status      source/viewer/frame counters
    GET  /sidecar     native Kinect sidecar lifecycle state
    POST /start       lazily spawn the native Kinect sidecar (guarded)
    POST /stop        stop the native Kinect sidecar
    WS   /ws/source   the sender: binary messages are JPEG frames or AKV1 frames
    WS   /ws/view     a VJ viewer: primed with the XY table + latest frame
