"""F0 (fundamental pitch) statistics via librosa.pyin.

This is most meaningful on monophonic content (vocals, lead lines) but
runs harmlessly on polyphonic material — pyin reports NaN where it
can't track confidently, and we filter those out.

Returns mean / std / median in Hz. No MIDI conversion here; callers do
that themselves if they want it.
