"""Admin-level operations exposed under /api/admin/*.

POST /api/admin/restart — schedules a clean re-exec of the backend.
Returns 202 immediately, then exits with sentinel code 88 so the
supervisor parent process (backend._devstack, or backend._supervisor)
respawns a fresh inner inside the same console. The frontend polls
/api/health until it comes back.

POST /api/admin/shutdown — schedules a CLEAN exit with rc=0. The
supervisor sees a non-restart exit code and terminates rather than
respawning, so the whole theDAW console closes. Used by the
SETTINGS modal's Shutdown button.
