> **GANTASMO** is an amorphous entity by [Daniel Joaquin Trujillo](https://github.com/danieljtrujillo) and [Josh Valenzuela](https://github.com/StarskreamEXE) that defies conventional classification. We make thought provoking, highly technical, yet listenable music inspired by the underappreciated pioneers of modern music. Beyond musical composition and performance, GANTASMO is a powerhouse of research and development in the fields Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, the democratization of musical tools and education, and the preservation and evolution of musical history and traditions predating modern recording infrastructure.

**theDAW** is an all-in-one music studio and live rig: composition, arrangement, editing, mixing, mastering, DJing, and VJing in **one** application, covering the whole path from a first idea to a finished render to a live set. Deep MIDI mapping reaches any controller, and [theDAW-XR](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW-XR) extends the rig to Meta Quest 3 for hands-only spatial control.

**Free here, subscription elsewhere.** Every tool below ships free and runs locally:

- Stem separation from 2 to 12 stems, plus live stemming on the DJ decks
- A full mixing and mastering suite: a 25-effect chain, Quick Master macros, and LUFS loudness metering
- High quality audio plugins, VST3 hosting, and VST instruments
- **The Owl**, a high quality HRTF spatializer
- DJ and VJ decks with **beatmatch** sync, keylock, and **Automix**
- audio2midi transcription, notation, and score engraving
- Distribution preparation: Smart Export to platform spec, dither, sample-rate conversion, tagging, and batch delivery
- LoRA training in the Underfit tab
- Conversion and export across essentially **every format**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, AIFF, Opus, M4A, MIDI, MusicXML

**Found nowhere else:**

- **theDAW-XR** hands-only spatial control over ADB, with no MQDH and no Quest Link
- **Chimera**, which analyzes, blends, and beat-aligns several source clips into one new piece
- **DRAW**, where drawn gestures become generative music
- Native **Audima Sway** support: the expressive-motion controller's six dimensions map straight onto the rig
- **The Foundry**, a plugin-interface designer that exports working `.gan` web-plugins
- **Interoperability** with the popular DAW formats: Ableton `.als`, Reaper `.rpp`, FL Studio `.flp`, Audacity, Audition, Bitwig, and Resolume
- Library analysis and track lineage: every render, remix, stem split, and blend draws its family tree in LEARN
- Auto MIDI mapping from a ~110-profile library, learn-by-capture, and controller recognition from a photo
- **Audio analysis**, a step sequencer, and a fully customizable interface with sixteen themes

**Make it once, open it anywhere.** The [Foundry](#foundry) lays out custom plugin interfaces on an infinite canvas and exports them as `.gan` web-plugins, GANTASMO's portable plugin format. The MIX chain hosts `.gan` plugins and native VST3s side by side, so a Foundry design sits next to a commercial plugin in the same rack, and **The Owl** and **Ares** ship as proof. Whole sessions save and reload as `.tasmo` projects, and existing work comes along too: theDAW imports Ableton `.als`, Reaper `.rpp`, FL Studio `.flp`, Audacity, Audition, Bitwig, and Resolume projects with their media and effects, with export hints for Logic, Cubase, and Pro Tools.

**The engines.** The generative engine renders audio from several inputs: supplied init audio, a text prompt, a painted inpaint region, and the **Chimera** stack. theDAW also ships **the first non-Mac port** of Google's Magenta RealTime 2, vendored as the [magenta-rt2-nvidia](https://github.com/gantasmo/magenta-rt2-nvidia) sidecar, which runs on Windows with WSL2 and NVIDIA, on native Linux, and on cloud GPUs. Models stay under the user's control: nothing downloads at startup, **local-only mode is on by default**, and a model loads at the first CREATE that needs it.

## Quickstart

**Double-click `theDAW.bat`. That is the entire setup.** It checks the machine, installs anything missing after one quick confirmation, and opens theDAW in the browser. The Stable Audio model downloads on its own the first time a track is generated.

```powershell
.\theDAW.bat
```

The launcher checks prerequisites, bootstraps dependencies when the tree is fresh (`uv sync --group dev`, `npm install`), clears stale processes on ports 5173/8600/5187, then runs the backend, Vite, and an optional tunnel together in one console and opens `http://localhost:5173`. Manual launch:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8600 --reload   # backend
cd frontend && npm run dev                                              # frontend
```

> The full [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) is a deep power-user reference. It runs long and parts can lag the current app, so it works best as a reference rather than a first stop. Quick links: [Windows Setup](docs/windows/setup-guide.md), [Prompting](docs/guides/prompting.md), [§3 Installation](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#3-installation).

### Prerequisites

`theDAW.bat` installs these automatically the first time a tool is missing. The list is here for reference and for manual or non-Windows setups.

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** | Python environment and package manager. Creates the venv and installs torch and CUDA. |
| **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.19+ or 22.12+** | Frontend dev server and the VJ sidecar. Vite 7 sets the floor. |
| **[FFmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)** on PATH | Every audio path: effects, exports, library ingest, MIDI conversion, import. |
| **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** | Clones the repo. `--recurse-submodules` brings in the Magenta sidecar source. |
| **NVIDIA driver 550+** | Runs the Medium model and Magenta. The Small model runs on CPU. |

## Install paths

Four routes install and run theDAW. Pick one.

- **Windows script install.** Double-click `theDAW.bat`. It preflights prerequisites, runs `install/setup.ps1` for consent-based tool installation, then launches the backend and UI. See [docs/windows/setup-guide.md](docs/windows/setup-guide.md).
- **Release packages.** Every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW/releases) ships a Windows installer (`theDAW-Setup-<version>.exe`), a macOS disk image (`theDAW-<version>.dmg`), and a container image at `ghcr.io/gantasmo/thedaw`. The installers carry the Electron desktop shell, which wraps the backend and UI in one window and starts them together. See [docs/guides/electron-desktop-app.md](docs/guides/electron-desktop-app.md).
- **Pinokio launcher.** The Pinokio script installs dependencies and starts theDAW from the Pinokio browser. See [docs/guides/pinokio-launcher.md](docs/guides/pinokio-launcher.md) and [github.com/gantasmo/theDAW-Pinokio](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW-Pinokio).
- **Source checkout.** `git clone --recurse-submodules`, then the manual launch commands under [Quickstart](#quickstart) on any OS.

## Workspaces

### MAKE

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/make-controls.png" alt="Generation controls for model, duration, sampler steps, CFG, seed, batch, and the sampler sigma fader" width="330"></p>

One form drives text-to-audio, audio-to-audio, inpainting, and continuation. Supplied init audio, a text prompt, a painted inpaint region, and a Chimera stack all condition the same generation, and the init noise level sets how far the result departs from the source. Chimera blends several clips into one generation and beat-aligns them under Start, Downbeat, or Phrase Weave alignment. Templates store full parameter sets, Saved Prompts keep a history, and the async job queue saves every render to the library. Full reference: [User Guide §6](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#6-make-tab).

### Generate

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/magenta.png" alt="Magenta RealTime 2 text-to-music panel, the first non-Mac MRT2 port" width="820"></p>

Suno cloud generation runs in the Aurora Cloud Console across simple, custom, cover, and mashup modes, and cover and mashup results write lineage edges. Magenta RealTime 2 provides text-to-music whenever its sidecar is running, through the first non-Mac MRT2 port vendored at [magenta-rt2-nvidia](https://github.com/gantasmo/magenta-rt2-nvidia). The extended sidecar also accepts MIDI-note and audio-style conditioning. Full reference: [User Guide §26](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#26-cloud-generation-suno) and [§27](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#27-magenta-realtime-2).

### EDIT

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/edit.png" alt="Multi-track timeline with per-clip waveforms, trim and fade handles, and the cut tool" width="820"></p>

The timeline holds many tracks, each clip caches its own waveform peaks, Move drags clips along and between tracks, and Cut splits a clip while preserving source alignment. Each track carries name, mute, solo, volume, and pan, and the live mixer applies them during playback. Commit Edit renders the audible tracks into one 44.1 kHz stereo WAV through `OfflineAudioContext`. Full reference: [User Guide §7](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#7-edit-tab).

### MIX

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/mix.png" alt="MIX effects browser, the flowing chain, and the Quick Master macro knobs" width="820"></p>

A chain of 25 FFmpeg effects covers mastering, compression, filters, vocal processing, lo-fi, stereo widening, reverb, delay, LUFS normalization, pitch shift, and export to FLAC, MP3, AAC, and Opus. Four macro sliders map onto the active effect, and process history keeps the last eight runs. The Edit Tool Stack adds six module families under `/api/edit/*`, whose GUIs iframe into the effect stage. VST3 plugins, scanned from the standard folders and hosted through [pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard), drop into the same chain, and `.gan` web-plugins (including **The Owl**, the front-end for the HRTF spatializer) render in the effect-stage footprint and drive the live rack. Full reference: [User Guide §8](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#8-mix-tab) and [§28](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#28-edit-tool-stack).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/readme/owl.png" alt="The Owl .gan web-plugin: the HRTF spatializer surface with the azimuth-elevation pad and the spatial-room pad" width="410">
  <img src="docs/readme/ares.png" alt="Ares .gan web-plugin: a reactive multi-effect surface with filter, delay, reverb, grains, and gate" width="410">
</p>

<sub align="center">The Owl and Ares are `.gan` web-plugins that render in the MIX effect stage. Each is a background image with controls placed on top, so the surface letterboxes to the artwork's native aspect ratio and never stretches.</sub>

### Perform

The Perform tab imports a project and plays its scenes and clips from a live launch grid. Scenes fire columns of clips together, individual clips trigger on their own, and the grid drives the arrangement while a set runs.

### DJ

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/dj.png" alt="Two-deck DJ console with jog wheels, the central mixer, and the FX rack" width="820"></p>

Two decks run from a pro layout with jog wheels, a central mixer, and a track browser. The engine handles octave-aware beatmatch sync, key-lock, a 3-band EQ, a single-knob filter, four hotcues, beat loops and rolls, slip mode, and quantize. The FX rack adds a flanger, an impulse-response reverb, and a resonant wah per deck, with a master limiter on the bus. Live stems ride on per-stem faders, cue output pre-listens through a headphone device chosen with `setSinkId`, and Automix sequences and crossfades a set on its own. Full reference: [User Guide §9](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#9-dj-tab).

### VJ

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/vj.png" alt="VJ tab running the GLSL shader source over the live audio bus, with deck FX and the source browser" width="820"></p>

The VJ tab embeds the [VJ-9000](https://github.com/gantasmo/VJ-9000) engine, which renders a glowing reactive terrain plus a unified set of live sources: cameras (webcam, phone, tablet, or Quest over the LAN), a GLSL shader source with fractals, eight materials, and audio-mapped params, an ASCII effect, cymatics, depth-cloud and spectra sources, and source banks for snapshot and recall. A composable GPU effect chain, Autopilot, BPM sync, and full MIDI mapping sit on top, and the take records to WebM and transcodes through the backend. Full reference: [User Guide §10](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#10-vj-tab).

### Foundry

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/foundry.png" alt="Foundry plugin-UI builder: an infinite canvas with a control palette, layers, and asset and texture libraries" width="820"></p>

The Foundry tab lays out **custom VST and plugin interfaces** on an infinite canvas. A finished design exports as a `.gan` web-plugin (GANTASMO's portable plugin format), which then hosts in the MIX chain alongside VST3 plugins and the built-in effects.

### Underfit

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/underfit.png" alt="Underfit LoRA trainer dashboard embedded in the tab, with the GPU meter and run list" width="820"></p>

Underfit fits LoRA adapters. Eight adapter types are available (`lora`, `dora-rows`, `dora-cols`, `bora`, and their `-xs` variants). Layer filtering runs through `--include` and `--exclude` with bracket-range expansion. Inference exposes runtime strength, per-LoRA interval gating within a sigma range, and a per-LoRA layer filter, and adapters stack additively. Full reference: [User Guide §22](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#22-lora-adapter-types).

### Audimate

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/audimate.png" alt="Audimate node canvas with a Library, Generate, Effect, and Output pipeline wired by glowing bezier edges" width="820"></p>

Audimate is a **node-graph editor** for building generation pipelines. Nodes for library sources, generation (Stable Audio or Magenta), effect, merge, and feedback stages, and outputs wire together with bezier edges on a pannable, zoomable canvas. The inspector edits each node's parameters (prompt, model, duration, steps, CFG, seed), and Run drives the graph through the same generate, effect, and library actions the rest of the app uses, saving results back to the library.

### LEARN

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/readme/learn-3d.png" alt="3D force-directed genealogy galaxy in fullscreen" width="410">
  <img src="docs/readme/learn-2d.png" alt="Layered 2D genealogy DAG in fullscreen" width="410">
</p>

Every track and the relationships between them render as an interactive force-directed graph in 3D and 2D through `react-force-graph` and three.js, alongside a layered SVG DAG. Edges trace how a piece descended from its sources, so a remix, an inpaint, a stem split, a Chimera blend, and a Suno cover each show their parentage. Full reference: [User Guide §12](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#12-learn-tab).

### Controllers and XR

Controller recognition identifies hardware across three tiers: a library of roughly 110 device profiles, a scored auto-detect, and a learn-by-capture mode that binds a control the moment it moves. Controller Vision identifies a controller from a photo through OpenCV and a vision model. The Audima Sway is supported natively: auto-detect recognizes it, its six expressive-motion dimensions arrive as named signals for MAKE, the MIX rack, and the VJ engine, and its control-surface mode mirrors play, volume, pan, and pads onto the EDIT timeline. The [theDAW-XR](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW-XR) companion turns a Meta Quest 3 into a hands-only surface: **hand-tracked MIDI** from floating faders and knobs, passthrough video into VJ, co-located multiplayer, and a head-mounted MIDI Reactor, all over ADB. Full reference: [User Guide §31](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#31-controller-vision) and [§34](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#34-quest-and-xr-integrations).

### Library and Catalogue

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/readme/library.png" alt="Disk-backed library browser with search, favorites, and inline playback" width="410">
  <img src="docs/readme/catalogue.png" alt="Cross-provider Catalogue gallery with provider badges and inspector" width="410">
</p>

The library lives on the backend, with audio on disk, metadata in `data/library.db`, and access over `/api/library/*`. Every render saves automatically with its prompt, model, duration, steps, CFG, seed, and timestamp. **SUGGEST** builds a continuous playlist ordered by Camelot-wheel harmony and a chosen BPM flow, then plays it through the footer queue or sends it to the DJ tab. The Catalogue view adds a cross-provider gallery with provider badges, an inspector with **on-demand spectrograms**, and a lineage panel. Full reference: [User Guide §13](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#13-library) and [§29](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#29-catalogue).

### Notation and Score

<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/score.png" alt="Score panel rendering the piano score from a track's MIDI" width="820"></p>

The Score tab turns a track's **MIDI into symbolic music**. MAKE SHEET converts the first MIDI to MusicXML with music21 and renders it through OpenSheetMusicDisplay. The Tabs section arranges guitar or bass tablature for a chosen tuning, capo, and difficulty through a dynamic-programming pass and renders with alphaTab. Arrange builds lead-sheet, piano-reduction, simplified, or band-score MusicXML, scores export to ABC, PDF, and SVG, and PROMPT INFERENCE derives a Stable Audio prompt from a track's analysis.

The spectral analyzer shows oscilloscope, spectrum, and radial modes with RMS and peak meters. The piano roll edits MIDI-style notes, imports and exports MIDI, and renders to the editor. The step sequencer runs a 16-step drum machine with five synthesized voices. The DRAW tab turns drawn gestures into generative music across Organic, Fibonacci, Neural, and Nebulous modes and records the result to the library or EDIT. The media bucket holds session audio, SLIDE presents a glass surface of faders and knobs synced with the VJ engine, and Details and Score show the selected entry.

### Footer, log, and assistant

The footer stays across every tab with the current title, a status chip, transport, a seek bar, a volume slider, and a download button. The processing log is a 500-entry ring buffer with leveled, color-coded lines and SIMPLE / VERBOSE view modes. The assistant orb streams chat from any configured provider, including Claude Code over the CLI, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI, Grok, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, and vLLM, with a hashed multi-key pool, attachments, and RAG over the docs through ChromaDB. Full reference: [User Guide §17](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#17-player-footer), [§18](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#18-processing-log), and [§32](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#32-admin-module-and-assistant-key-apis).

## Ecosystem

theDAW is the hub of a small constellation of repositories, each with its own README and badges.

| Project | Repo | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **VJ-9000** | [![VJ-9000](https://img.shields.io/badge/gantasmo-VJ--9000-61DAFB?logo=webgl&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/gantasmo/VJ-9000) | The WebGL audio-reactive visual engine embedded in the VJ tab and runnable standalone. |
| **magenta-rt2-nvidia** | [![magenta-rt2-nvidia](https://img.shields.io/badge/gantasmo-magenta--rt2--nvidia-EE4C2C?logo=nvidia&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/gantasmo/magenta-rt2-nvidia) | The first non-Mac port of Magenta RealTime 2, vendored at `sidecars/magenta-rt2-nvidia`. |
| **theDAW-XR** | [![theDAW-XR](https://img.shields.io/badge/gantasmo-theDAW--XR-5A3FC0?logo=meta&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW-XR) | The Meta Quest 3 spatial companion: hand-tracked MIDI, passthrough streaming, and colocation. |

In-tree sidecars under `sidecars/` (`questcast`, `queststitch`, `magenta`) and the backend modules under `backend/modules/` bridge these into theDAW over `/api/*`.

---

## Structure

| Component | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream ML pipeline** | `stable_audio_3/` | DiT diffusion transformer, SAME autoencoder, all samplers, LoRA training and inference, distribution-shift schedules. |
| **FastAPI backend** | `backend/server.py` | Async HTTP wrapper running a generation job queue, FFmpeg audio processing, and model introspection on port 8600. |
| **Backend modules** | `backend/modules/` | Plugin system. Each subdirectory provides `module.json` and `router.py`, and the loader mounts every enabled module and isolates failures. The repo ships 42 modules, including `analysis`, `analyzer`, `chimera`, `controllervision`, `convert`, `effects`, `library`, `midi`, `notation`, `settings`, `stems`, `storage`, `vj`, and `ytimport`, the cloud and real-time engines (`suno`, `magenta`), the XR bridges (`questmidi`, `questcast`, `queststitch`, `xrcontrol`, `quest`), the `foundry` plugin designer, the `underfit` LoRA trainer, the `akvj` depth pipeline, `broadcast` for watch-link, `modeldl`, and the Edit Tool Stack under `/api/edit/*`. |
| **theDAW interface** | `frontend/` | React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind 4, Zustand 5. Ten workspaces (MAKE, EDIT, MIX, Perform, DJ, VJ, Foundry, Underfit, Audimate, Learn) plus the library, the Catalogue, and the live tools. The dev server on port 5173 proxies `/api/*` to the backend. |
| **Sidecars** | `sidecars/` | The vendored `magenta-rt2-nvidia` port, the `questcast` and `queststitch` Quest bridges, and the `magenta` studio sidecar. |

### Folder map

The table above maps the components; the tree below is the same root as it looks on a first run, with the folders a new user actually touches called out.

```
stable-audio-3/
|-- theDAW.bat        <-- double-click this to install everything and launch (backend :8600, UI :5173)
|-- backend/          <-- FastAPI server and the plugin modules behind /api/*

|-- local_models.txt  <-- OPTIONAL: extra checkpoint folders to search, one path per line
|-- tests/            <-- the pytest suite for the inference library
|-- scripts/          <-- automation that captures the screenshots and the feature tour
\-- .venv/            <-- created by uv sync; the Python environment (no need to touch it)
```

**Where do models go?**

- **The built-in models need no manual placement.** Every load resolves local-first: local model folders, then the Hugging Face cache at `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\hub\` (relocatable by setting `HF_HOME` before launch), then a one-time download into that cache. **Local only (never download)** is on by default for fresh installs, so nothing fetches until it is allowed in **Settings → Models**; once allowed, the weights download automatically on the first generation that needs them (the `medium` checkpoint is roughly 17 GB), and the T5Gemma text encoder fetches into the same cache.
- **A checkpoint already on disk** registers through the **Add** control in **Settings → Models**: browse to the folder (or the `.safetensors` file itself) and it appears in the MAKE model picker. Entries persist in `data/local_checkpoints.json`, and removing one never touches the files.
- **The folder convention** works without the UI: create `models/` at the repo root (or list extra directories in `local_models.txt`, one path per line, or in the `SA3_LOCAL_MODELS_DIR` environment variable, `;`-separated on Windows) and give each checkpoint a subfolder named after its Hugging Face repo, for example `models/stable-audio-3-medium/` holding the config JSON and the `.safetensors`. [User Guide §21.2](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#212-manual-model-placement-download-links-and-folder-tree) has the full download table.
- **Magenta RealTime 2 models are not placed by hand.** `sidecars/magenta-rt2-nvidia/Setup-MRT2.bat` installs the WSL2 engine and its assets in one pass.

## Architecture

theDAW is a React frontend over a FastAPI backend that wraps the Stable Audio 3 pipeline, a plugin module system, and spawned sidecars. The frontend proxies `/api/*` to the backend on port 8600. Heavy features (the AI assistant, the MIDI tab, and the in-app docs) are code-split and load on first use rather than at boot, and the startup cinematic ships its logo, environment map, and model at display resolution, so the workspace paints quickly. The wiki [Dataflow](https://github.com/gantasmo/theDAW/wiki/Dataflow) page maps every input and output in one chart.

**System.**

```

**Generation.** Several inputs condition one generation; the DiT renders latents, the autoencoder decodes them, every render saves to the library, and LEARN draws the lineage.

**Routing.** Player audio, a microphone, MIDI, and SLIDE drive the VJ engine and the DJ console, and theDAW-XR feeds hand-tracked MIDI and passthrough video into the same buses.

## Models

| Key | Flavor | Params | Autoencoder | Hardware | Max Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `small` | ARC | 433 M | SAME-S | CPU | 120 s |
| `medium` | ARC | 1.4 B | SAME-L | GPU (CUDA) | 380 s |
| `small-rf` / `medium-rf` | RF | 433 M / 1.4 B | SAME-S / SAME-L | CPU / GPU | 120 / 380 s |
| `same-s` / `same-l` | Autoencoder | 266 M / 1.7 B | n/a | CPU / GPU | n/a |

ARC checkpoints are post-trained for 8-step inference at `cfg_scale=1`. RF checkpoints are rectified-flow bases for LoRA training at `cfg_scale=7` and roughly 50 steps. This table lists the primary keys; the specialized release checkpoints (`small-music`, `small-sfx`, and the `medium-base` / `music-base` / `sfx-base` variants) and their exact folders are catalogued in [User Guide §21.2](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#212-manual-model-placement-download-links-and-folder-tree). Nothing downloads at startup; a model loads on the first generation that needs it, and the in-app **Settings, then Models** panel can register checkpoints already on disk.

## Python API

```python
from stable_audio_3 import StableAudioModel
pipe = StableAudioModel.from_pretrained("medium")

# Text-to-audio
audio = pipe.generate(prompt="Lo-fi boom bap meets orchestral strings, 84 BPM", duration=180)

# Audio-to-audio. init_noise_level sets how far the result departs from the source.
audio = pipe.generate(init_audio=torchaudio.load("in.wav"), init_noise_level=0.9,
                      prompt="bossa nova bassline", duration=30)

# LoRA stacks additively; runtime strength is adjustable.
pipe.load_lora("style.safetensors")
pipe.set_lora_strength(0.8)
audio = pipe.generate(
    prompt="...", duration=30,
    sampler_type="dpmpp",          # euler | rk4 | dpmpp | pingpong
    apg_scale=1.0,                 # Adaptive Projected Guidance
    cfg_interval=(0.0, 1.0),       # apply CFG only within this sigma range
)
```

[docs/workflows/lora.md](docs/workflows/lora.md) covers adapter types and layer filters, and [docs/workflows/autoencoder.md](docs/workflows/autoencoder.md) covers the standalone autoencoder.

## Layout and themes

The interface restyles and rearranges without touching a config file.

**Change theme.** The hamburger menu opens the Change Theme modal: sixteen themes spanning dark, metallic, paper, pastel, and color families, plus a custom mode that builds a theme from any background image. A theme recolors every surface in the app through shared design tokens, from the EDIT timeline to the DJ console. Obsidian is the default.

<p align="center">

</p>

<sub align="center">Obsidian and Graphite from the dark family, Porcelain and Paper from the paper family, Aurora and Sunset from the color family.</sub>

**Edit layout.** The workspace itself adjusts per session: the library panel collapses, the right panel resizes, the bottom panel swaps between its tabs (analyzer, piano roll, sequencer, bucket, SLIDE, Details, Score), the LEARN graph toggles fullscreen, and the DJ tab's Design Mode rearranges the console.

## Automation

theDAW generates its own documentation and promo material from the live app. `scripts/screenshots/` drives a real session to capture feature screenshots and a coverage report, and `frontend/_capture_clips.mjs` is a Playwright harness that records the running app into the feature-tour video. The in-app assistant answers from these same documents through a ChromaDB RAG index, so the docs, the video, and the assistant stay sourced from one place.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Static glitch output on the Medium model.** Flash Attention is not installed correctly. Verify it with `uv run python -c "from flash_attn import flash_attn_func; import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"` and reinstall a wheel matching the Python, torch, and CUDA combination from [kingbri1/flash-attention](https://github.com/kingbri1/flash-attention/releases).

**"API UNREACHABLE" banner.** The backend is not listening on port 8600. Test it with `curl http://localhost:8600/api/health`. On Windows, `.\theDAW.bat` clears stale processes automatically.

**Out-of-memory on the Medium model.** The `small` model, a shorter `duration`, or freeing competing CUDA processes resolves it.

[User Guide §23](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#23-troubleshooting) has the full matrix.
